            <p>So I was just hanging out, right? When Buck jumped out of this bush and tried to steal my bird! I barely dodge rolled out of the way in time, but like, what the hell!? Doesn't he know that Zigs wouldn't even match his outfit? I mean don't get me wrong, I love my little Ziggy-poo but he's the accessory that bring the whole outfit together and I just couldn't live without hiiim. And can you believe he was using the standard shotgun? That weapon is sooo last year, anyway. So then I shot buck with a disengage and he went right off the edge of frog isle, haha! What a loooser!</p>
